      Hey there, I'm Enoch Torres, and I've been on a unique journey for over 30 years now. I've been helping folks who've hit a bump in the road due to DWI convictions, and it's been quite a ride. Enoch Recovery DDP Center is where it all happens, and we're more like a big support system for people who need a fresh start.
